Dear all,

Matlab m-files for the LPC encoder/decoder blocks in EE-430 project is uploaded to ODTU-Class. It is not compulsary to use those functions for project phase-2, as no real-time operation is required for phase-2 of the EE-430 project (LPC encoder/decoder blocks are to reduce the bit rate requirement for real-time operation, you may also convert the sound signal to be transmitted to binary data at the transmitter and reconstruct the sound signal at the receiver side from the detected bits at the receiver side, without using any LPC encoder/decoder. However, you will ultimately need to use LPC encoder/decoder at the final phase, as the bit rate requirement will be very high without LPC to accommodate a real-time operation (in which you will not have, say 30 seconds, to transmit a sound signal of 1 second duration).

There are some explanations for how to use the LPC encoder/decoder when you click on the folder "LPC encoder/decoder matlab files" in ODTU-Class. In those explanations, there are also some important information for how to start the project implementation step by step if you still have not started, so make sure that you read them carefully.

Good luck with your studies.
